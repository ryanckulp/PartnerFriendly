# PartnerFriendly

Are you a marketer? PartnerFriendly is for you.

When savvy users sign up for your application, they may append their email with strings like "+yourapp" preceding "@theirdomain.com."

They do this to identify you in the case that they unsolicited email from one of your partners, such as a co-branded marketing newsletter.

PartnerFriendly neutralizes this issue by removing such identifiers, rendering an input like:
